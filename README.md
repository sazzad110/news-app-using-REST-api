# Project Title & Overview
The Flutter News App is a mobile application designed to provide users with access to the latest news articles from various sources. The app fetches news data from the News API (newsapi.org) using a custom-built model and API services. This documentation serves as a guide for understanding the project structure, implementation details, and usage instructions.


## Key Features:
- News API Integration: The app integrates with the News API to fetch real-time news data. The integration is achieved through a custom model designed to handle the structure of the API response.

- Top News and All News Views: The app offers two main views - "Top News" and "All News." Users can switch between these views to either see the most relevant and popular headlines or explore a broader range of news articles.

- Custom Model: A dedicated model is implemented to parse and structure the data received from the News API. This model ensures seamless integration and easy manipulation of news-related information within the app.

- API Services: The app utilizes custom API services to interact with the News API. These services encapsulate the logic for making requests to the API endpoints, handling responses, and delivering the data to the app components
## Project Structure:
